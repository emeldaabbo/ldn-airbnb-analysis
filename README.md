## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using the Inside Airbnb listings data from 2019 and 2020 to better understand 
**how hosts have coped with the COVID-19 pandemic in London**. 

The below questions were explored:

1. Did the number of listings on Airbnb decrease since the start of the pandemic?
2. Did the pandemic impact hosts across London equally?
3. Were there any changes in the types of accommodations listed on the platform?
4. Did hosts try to lower the prices of their listings to encourage renters to book?

## Files Description <a name="files"></a>

The `data_analysis.ipynb` notebook showcases the work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist
in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

The `data` folder contains the listings files downloaded from the Inside Airbnb website.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of this analysis can be found in the Medium post available [here](https://medium.com/@emelda.abbo/airbnb-under-the-microscope-how-have-hosts-coped-with-the-covid-19-pandemic-in-london-6f482f2083b4).
